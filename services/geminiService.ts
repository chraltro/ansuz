You MUST respond by streaming explanations as individual JSON objects, one per line:
{"code_block": "exact verbatim code snippet", "explanation": "markdown explanation"}
{"code_block": "next exact verbatim code snippet", "explanation": "markdown explanation"}
...

**CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT RULES:**
1. **ONE JSON OBJECT PER LINE:** Each code block and explanation pair must be a separate JSON object on its own line.
2. **VERBATIM CODE:** The "code_block" value MUST be an exact, verbatim, character-for-character copy of a snippet from the original file.
3. **SEQUENTIAL & NON-REPEATING:** Process the file sequentially from top to bottom. Once you explain a code block, DO NOT include it again.

**EXPLANATION & MARKDOWN STYLE RULES:**
- **MANDATORY Markdown:** All "explanation" values must be in well-formatted Markdown.
- **NO TABLES:** You MUST NOT use markdown tables. Use bulleted lists instead.
- **Paragraphs are REQUIRED:** Break up ideas into separate paragraphs (blank lines).
- **Correct Spacing for Lists:** Insert a blank line before starting any bulleted or numbered list.
- **Bulleted Lists for Enumerations:** Use bulleted lists (\`* item\`) for multiple items.
- **Bold for Emphasis:** Use **bold text** to highlight key terms.`;

**BEGINNER-LEVEL EXPLANATION STYLE:**
- Use simple, everyday language (avoid jargon where possible)
- Explain basic programming concepts (e.g., "A variable is like a box that stores a value")
- Break down complex logic into small, digestible steps
- Mention what the code does AND why it might be useful
- Use analogies when helpful
- Don't assume prior knowledge of the language or framework

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
{"code_block": "const name = 'John';", "explanation": "This creates a **variable** called \`name\` which stores the text 'John'.\\n\\nThink of a variable like a labeled box where you can keep information to use later in your program."}

- Discuss trade-offs, performance implications, and alternatives
- Mention edge cases, potential bugs, or code smells
- Reference best practices and modern standards
- Analyze why specific approaches were chosen
- Suggest improvements where relevant

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

2.  **JSON STRUCTURE:** The JSON object must have a single key "blocks". The value must be an array of objects. Each object in the array represents a sequential code block and its explanation, with the keys "code_block" and "explanation".

**CRITICAL EXPLANATION & MARKDOWN STYLE RULES:**
- **MANDATORY Markdown:** All "explanation" values must be in well-formatted Markdown.
- **NO TABLES:** You MUST NOT use markdown tables. Use bulleted lists instead for tabular data.
- **Paragraphs are REQUIRED:** Break up ideas into separate paragraphs. A paragraph is text separated by a blank line.
- **Correct Spacing for Lists:** YOU MUST insert a blank line before starting any bulleted or numbered list.
- **Bulleted Lists for Enumerations:** When explaining multiple items (e.g., function parameters, object properties, logical steps), you MUST use a bulleted list (\`* item\`).
- **Bold for Emphasis:** Use **bold text** to highlight key terms.

**CRITICAL MARKDOWN FORMATTING RULES:**
- **MANDATORY Markdown:** Your entire response must be well-formatted Markdown.
- **Use Paragraphs:** Separate distinct ideas with blank lines to form paragraphs.
- **Correct List Spacing:** YOU MUST insert a blank line before starting any list. This is critical for readability.
    - **CORRECT:**

- Focus on the file's main purpose and role
- No markdown formatting
- Be concise but informative

**Project Summary Rules:**
- Maximum 3 sentences total
- Use 2-3 short paragraphs separated by blank lines
- Synthesize the overall project purpose from all files
- Focus on high-level architecture and goals

**Example Output Format:**
